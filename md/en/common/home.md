# Bizen ware promotion activities

We have entered into an industry-government-academia collaboration agreement with Bizen City in Okayama, and are promoting "Bizen ware" a pottery that is registered as a Japanese Heritage.
Traditional Japanese crafts are popular, especially among people overseas, but in fact, domestic consumption has fallen sharply, making it difficult to pass on the techniques and continue operations.
We will conduct research on the theme of "Building a case study for promoting traditional craft culture using blockchain technology and DAO, and using the latest technology to save ancient cultures from disappearing."
