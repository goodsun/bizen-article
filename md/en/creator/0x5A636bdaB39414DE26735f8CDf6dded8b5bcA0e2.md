## always want to be a traveling potter.

I like to go somewhere.

Through creating Bizen ware, I like myself changing the way to make, reviewing the way Bizen ware should be, and changing my perspective to a new one.

It is also a “trip”, isn't it?

Feeling the gradual changes in the world every day, I am walking to lead my life so that I can leave my journey footprints of my own as the one living in the present age.

# My definition of Bizen pottery

I define Bizen ware as pottery produced in the Bizen area, using high-quality soil and minerals from the Bizen area of Okayama Prefecture, and firing at a high temperature of 1200 to 1300 degrees.

# About the onomatopoeia series

  At first, I passively entered the field of pottery at the recommendation of my grandfather (Furai) and other family members. His grandfather passed away shortly after I started making pottery, so I taught myself how to fire a kiln through trial and error. Being actively involved with Bizen ware has brought me closer to it. Now, I approach clay with the joy of expressing myself using clay from the land where I was born. Recently, I've started creating a series of onomatopoeias, inspired by the way children name new things with onomatopoeia. I name my works with onomatopoeias, create works based on images from onomatopoeias, and turn the onomatopoeias into manga-like expressions. We use this method to think outside the box of traditional images when creating something new. For me, it's a family business, so it's also a way for me to get rid of the image I've unconsciously fixed. While paying respect to our predecessors, I hope to create new boundaries for Bizen ware that are unique to today's era.
