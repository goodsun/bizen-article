To express the beauty of the Bizen soil cannot be done in a day.
I do not compromise with the selection of soil. I take time and effort to make clay and pursue the perfect shape and scenery that suits for it.
Even if it ends up to overturn the conventional concept of Bizen, I continue to face its essence.
I would like to create innovative Bizen ware that is never bound by the frame, in addition to the traditional “beauty of use”.

# My definition of Bizen pottery

I define Bizen ware as pottery that uses high-quality soil and minerals from the Bizen region of Okayama Prefecture and is fired at a high temperature of 1200 to 1300 degrees.

# About White Bizen Ware

”White bizen” was popular during the Edo period. It was made from white clay containing various components mined in Japan.
Syo Fujita uses pure white ceramic stones which excavated 156 meters underground from a mine in the Mitsuishi district of Bizen City and makes unglazed fired ware.
The new White Bizen has high light transmittance. It's beautiful because it's created so transparently.
